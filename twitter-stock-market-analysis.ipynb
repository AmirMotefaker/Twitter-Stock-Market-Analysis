The company operated the social networking service Twitter and previously the Vine short video app and Periscope livestreaming service. \n\n- Twitter, rebranding to X in July 2023, is an online social media and social networking service operated by the American company X Corp., the successor of Twitter, Inc. On Twitter, registered users can post texts, images and videos. Users can post (tweet), like, repost (or retweet), comment and quote posts, and direct message other registered users. Users interact with Twitter through browser or mobile frontend software, or programmatically via its application programming interfaces (APIs).\n\n- Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams.

By 2012, more than 100 million users produced 340 million tweets a day, and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries per day. In 2013, it was one of the ten most-visited websites and has been described as \"the SMS of the Internet\" By the start of 2019, Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users. In practice, the vast majority of tweets are produced by a minority of users. In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million accounts (15% of all accounts) were not genuine people\n\n- In October 2022, billionaire Elon Musk acquired Twitter for US$44 billion, gaining control of the platform and becoming CEO.

In July 2023, Musk announced that Twitter would be rebranded to X and that the bird logo would be phased out.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Twitter Stock Market Analysis\n\n- Twitter started its journey in the stock market in 2013.
